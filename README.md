# 📊 AI-Powered Auto Insights in Power BI using Python

Welcome to this project where I combine the power of **Power BI**, **Python**, and **AI** to generate automated data insights from a real-world sales dataset. This project marks my first step into integrating **Artificial Intelligence with Business Intelligence**, opening doors to building smarter, more dynamic dashboards.

## 🚀 Project Summary

In today’s fast-paced data world, users don’t just want charts—they want **instant insights**. In this project, I embedded a Python script inside Power BI to generate **auto-summarized insights** based on real-time slicer selections.

This is the beginning of my AI journey as a Data Analyst, and here I’ve focused on:

- 📌 Creating insightful summaries with **Python (Pandas + Matplotlib)**
- 📌 Dynamically displaying those insights in Power BI
- 📌 Using **Power BI slicers** (Month) to control filters and observe changes
- 📌 Styling the visual output to align with dashboard aesthetics
- 📌 Keeping everything beginner-friendly and easy to follow

## 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset used (`sales_data.xlsx`) contains fictional but realistic sales data with the following fields:

- `Region`: Region of sale (North, South, East, West)
- `Sales_Rep`: Salesperson responsible
- `Product_Category`: Product type (Electronics, Furniture, etc.)
- `Sales_Amount`: Monetary value of each sale
- `Quantity_Sold`: Number of units sold
- `Customer_Type`: New or Returning customer
- `Order_Date`: When the order was placed

The data is cleaned and duplicates removed before analysis begins.

## 📈 Auto Insights Output (Example)

Below is a sample auto-generated insight produced via Python inside Power BI:
Auto Insights:

- Best Region: North
- Top Sales Rep: David
- Top Category: Clothing
- Top Customer Type: Returning


This text updates based on slicer selections, allowing users to instantly understand performance trends.
